## üéÆ What the Bot Does

### Bot Monitoring (ü§ñ)
- Monitors servers where your bot is invited
- Gets full member details and real-time join events
- Provides complete user information

### User Monitoring (üë§)
- Monitors servers where you're a member but bot isn't invited
- Uses your user account to detect new members
- Provides limited but useful information

### Notifications
- Sends Discord DMs when new members join
- Shows monitoring source (Bot vs User)
- Includes user details, account age, and server info

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Basic Settings (in config.yaml)
```yaml
# How often to check for new members (seconds)
user_monitoring:
  check_interval: 300  # 5 minutes

# Notification settings
notifications:
  method: "discord_dm"    # Where to send notifications
  frequency: "instant"    # When to send them
  detailed_format: true   # Include full user details

# Filter settings
filters:
  ignore_bots: true              # Don't notify for bots
  minimum_account_age_days: 0    # Minimum account age
```

### Performance Settings
```yaml
# Adjust for your system
performance:
  rate_limit_buffer: 1.0    # Delay between API calls
  memory_limit_mb: 512      # Memory usage limit
  
# Logging
logging:
  level: "INFO"             # DEBUG for troubleshooting
  file: "logs/bot.log"      # Log file location
```

## üîí Security Notes

### Keep Your Tokens Safe
- **Never share** your bot token or user token
- **Don't post** them in Discord or online
- **Regenerate** tokens if compromised

### User Token Warning
- Your user token gives **full access** to your Discord account
- The bot only uses it to monitor servers
- **Keep it secure** and never share it

### Windows Defender
- May flag Python files as suspicious
- Add Discord_bot folder to exclusions if needed
- This is normal for Python applications

---

## üìä Monitoring Multiple Servers

### Server Types
- **Bot-invited servers**: Full monitoring with complete data
- **User-member servers**: Limited monitoring with basic data
- **Excluded servers**: Listed in config, not monitored

### Expected Behavior
- Bot discovers all servers automatically
- Shows monitoring method in logs
- Handles inaccessible servers gracefully

### Example Log Output
```
INFO - Found 9 guilds where user is a member
INFO - No member count available for Server_Name, trying alternative monitoring methods
INFO - Detected potential new member through channel activity in Server_Name
INFO - Processing user monitoring join: username in Server_Name
INFO - Notification sent for username in Server_Name (via user monitoring)
```
